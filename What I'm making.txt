What I'm making:

I am making a project inspired by Vib-ribbion.
Basically, vector graphics.

Just start by making a clone of asteroids. 
Break the asteroids, pieces fly across the screen, etc.
That adds points.

The goal is to survive as long as possible, and destroy as many to get points.

The signature style will be the wobbly vector graphics.

-- OR --

Create a walking mech going across the screen.
As he marches, shoot asteroids coming out of the sky, and obstacles in your way.
This is more vib-ribbon inspired.

-- Structure --

Screens are loaded in level classes. 
Cross-reference collision logic (using mouse pos, etc.)
Each component will have a 'squiggle' construct.
	- This helps to add that squiggly boil effect; displacement of vectors.

You may need to learn how to read off other files (like JSON).
You can do it. 

--- Plan ---

Start by setting up the main menu screen and elements.
Then build the game that runs after that.
